# Binaries used by PILOT Drive

## AAPT2

 From [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/tools/aapt2): "AAPT2 (Android Asset Packaging Tool) is a build tool that Android Studio and Android Gradle Plugin use to compile and package your app's resources. AAPT2 parses, indexes, and compiles the resources into a binary format that is optimized for the Android platform."

 PILOT Drive utilizes AAPT2 to pull information on ADB packages, and will only be installed on you machine if you opt to enable notifications over Android.

 Binaries were built thanks to the wonderful repo/github actions forked from [revanced](https://github.com/revanced/aapt2)
